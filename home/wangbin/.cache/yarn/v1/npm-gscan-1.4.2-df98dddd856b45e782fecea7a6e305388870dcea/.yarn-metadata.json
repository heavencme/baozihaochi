    "readme": "# GScan\n\nChecks Ghost themes for errors, deprecations, best practices and looks to see which features are supported. \nAims to generate a compatibility report and feature listing for themes.\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are 3 ways to use gscan to validate your theme:\n\n### 1. Web usage\n\nVisit https://gscan.ghost.org and upload your zip to our online version of Gscan.\n\n### 2. CLI usage\n\nInstall using yarn / npm:\n\n`yarn global add gscan` /  `npm install -G gscan`\n\nTo run a local directory through the checks:\n\n`gscan /path/to/theme/directory`\n\nTo run a local zip file through the checks:\n\n`gscan /path/to/theme.zip -z`\n\n### 3. Lib usage\n\nInstall using yarn/npm and then:\n\n```js\nvar gscan = require('gscan');\n\ngscan.checkZip({\n    path: 'path-to-zip',\n    name: 'my-theme'\n}).then(function (result) {\n    console.log(result);\n}).catch(function(err) {\n    console.log(err);\n});\n```\n\n## Development\n\n### Run\n\n- Either dev mode: `yarn dev`\n- Or standard server: `yarn start`\n- View: http://localhost:2369\n\n### Publish\n\n(Core team only)\n\n- `yarn ship`\n- Or if you DGAF `yarn ship --yolo`  (skip yarn install, deploy local deps)\n\n## Result types:\n\n- Errors: these are issues which will cause your theme to not work properly. These must be fixed.\n- Warnings: these are usually related to deprecated features. These should be fixed.\n- Recommendations: these are advisories about best practice. Fixing these will improve your theme.\n- Features: detected features which may impact on compatibility. Nothing to do :)\n\n## Still To Do:\n\n- Support for running the checks against a GitHub repository\n- Many, many more checks\n- Detailed advice for each check/result\n- Compatibility report\n- Feature listing\n\n# Copyright & License\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2018 Ghost Foundation - Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
