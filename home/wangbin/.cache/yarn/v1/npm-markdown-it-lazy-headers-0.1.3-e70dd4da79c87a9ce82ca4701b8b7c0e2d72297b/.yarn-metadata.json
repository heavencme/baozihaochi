    "readme": "# markdown-it-lazy-headers\n\n`markdown-it-lazy-headers` is a plugin for\n[`markdown-it`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) that relaxes the\nsyntax of [ATX headers](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.22/#atx-header) so that you\ndon't have to follow the opening sequence of `#` characters by a space. Should\nyou have any problems while installing or using `markdown-it-lazy-headers`\nplease open up a\n[new issue](https://github.com/Galadirith/markdown-it-lazy-headers/issues).\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save markdown-it-lazy-headers\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n`markdown-it-lazy-headers` has no configuration options, simply `use` it with an\ninstance of `markdown-it` to enable lazy headers:\n\n```\nvar md = require('markdown-it')()\n        .use(require('markdown-it-lazy-headers'));\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n`markdown-it-testgen` through `mocha` is used to test\n`markdown-it-lazy-headers`. The test suite is a modified version of the ATX\nheader suite used by commonmark:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\n## License\n\n`markdown-it-lazy-headers` is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).\n",
