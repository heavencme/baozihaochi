Otherwise false.\n#### #getTimestamp()\n**returns** the generation `Date` (accurate up to the second) that this `ObjectID` was generated.\n\n### ObjectID.createFromTime(time)\nCreates an ObjectID from a time (in seconds) `Number`, with the rest of the `ObjectID` zeroed out. Used for comparisons or sorting the ObjectID.\n\n### ObjectID.createFromHexString(hexString)\nCreates an ObjectID from a 24 character hex string.\n\n### ObjectID.isValid(hexString)<br>ObjectID.isValid(ObjectID)\nChecks if a value is a valid `ObjectID` or 24 character hex string.\n> THE NATIVE DOCUMENTATION ISN'T CLEAR ON THIS GUY!<br>\n> See: http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/api-bson-generated/objectid.html#objectid-isvalid\n\n### ObjectID.generate()<br>ObjectID.generate(time)\nYou can use this to generate a 24 character hex string without instantiating a `ObjectID` instance.\n\nThis diverges from [bson](https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson)'s implementation which returns the 12 byte string.\n\n**returns** a valid 24 character `ObjectID` hex string.\n\n### ObjectID.setMachineID(number)<br>ObjectID.setMachineID(string)\nYou can use this to set a custom machine-id.\nIt should be a 6 character hex string or a 3 byte integer and will truncate all larger values.\n\n### ObjectID.getMachineID()\n**returns** the machine-id as a 3 byte int.\n\n## Test\n    mocha\n\nor\n\n    npm test\n\nLicense\n=======\nApache v2.0\n\nSee LICENSE file.\n\nSpecial callout to [@feross](https://github.com/feross) for the [is-buffer](https://github.com/feross/is-buffer) code\nused internally to avoid Buffer from being loaded in browserify environments.\n",
