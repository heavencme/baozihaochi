Simply type the following\ninto a terminal window:\n\n```sh\nnpm install aws-sdk\n```\n\n## Usage and Getting Started\n\nYou can find a getting started guide at:\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/\n\n## Supported Services\n\n<p class=\"note\"><strong>Note</strong>:\nAlthough all services are supported in the browser version of the SDK,\nnot all of the services are available in the default hosted build (using the\nscript tag provided above). A list of services in the hosted build are provided\nin the \"<a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/browser-services.html\">Working With Services</a>\"\nsection of the browser SDK guide, including instructions on how to build a\ncustom version of the SDK with extra services.\n</p>\n\nThe SDK currently supports the following services:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <th>Service Name</th>\n    <th>Class Name</th>\n    <th>API Version</th>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Amazon CloudFront</td><td>AWS.CloudFront</td><td>2014-05-31</td></tr>\n    <tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Amazon CloudSearch</td><td rowspan=\"2\">AWS.CloudSearch</td><td>2011-02-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>2013-01-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon CloudSearch Domain</td><td>AWS.CloudSearchDomain</td><td>2013-01-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon CloudWatch</td><td>AWS.CloudWatch</td><td>2010-08-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Amazon DynamoDB</td><td rowspan=\"2\">AWS.DynamoDB</td><td>2011-12-05</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>2012-08-10</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</td><td>AWS.EC2</td><td>2014-05-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Elastic MapReduce</td><td>AWS.EMR</td><td>2009-03-31</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Elastic Transcoder</td><td>AWS.ElasticTranscoder</td><td>2012-09-25</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon ElastiCache</td><td>AWS.ElastiCache</td><td>2014-03-24</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Glacier</td><td>AWS.Glacier</td><td>2012-06-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Kinesis</td><td>AWS.Kinesis</td><td>2013-12-02</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Redshift</td><td>AWS.Redshift</td><td>2012-12-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Amazon Relational Database Service</td><td rowspan=\"3\">AWS.RDS</td><td>2013-01-10</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>2013-02-12</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>2013-09-09</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Route 53</td><td>AWS.Route53</td><td>2013-04-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Simple Email Service</td><td>AWS.SES</td><td>2010-12-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Simple Notification Service</td><td>AWS.SNS</td><td>2010-03-31</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Simple Queue Service</td><td>AWS.SQS</td><td>2012-11-05</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Simple Storage Service</td><td>AWS.S3</td><td>2006-03-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon Simple Workflow Service</td><td>AWS.SWF</td><td>2012-01-25</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Amazon SimpleDB</td><td>AWS.SimpleDB</td><td>2009-04-15</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Auto Scaling</td><td>AWS.AutoScaling</td><td>2011-01-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS CloudFormation</td><td>AWS.CloudFormation</td><td>2010-05-15</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS CloudTrail</td><td>AWS.CloudTrail</td><td>2013-11-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS Data Pipeline</td><td>AWS.DataPipeline</td><td>2012-10-29</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS Direct Connect</td><td>AWS.DirectConnect</td><td>2012-10-25</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</td><td>AWS.ElasticBeanstalk</td><td>2010-12-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS Identity and Access Management</td><td>AWS.IAM</td><td>2010-05-08</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS Import/Export</td><td>AWS.ImportExport</td><td>2010-06-01</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS OpsWorks</td><td>AWS.OpsWorks</td><td>2013-02-18</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS Security Token Service</td><td>AWS.STS</td><td>2011-06-15</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS Storage Gateway</td><td>AWS.StorageGateway</td><td>2013-06-30</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>AWS Support</td><td>AWS.Support</td><td>2013-04-15</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Elastic Load Balancing</td><td>AWS.ELB</td><td>2012-06-01</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n## License\n\nThis SDK is distributed under the\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0),\nsee LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt for more information.\n",
